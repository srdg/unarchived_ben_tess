# UnarchivingBengali 

The objective of this research is to upgrade/fine-tune the `.traineddata` 
model of Google's open source OCR engine [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr) so that 
the out-of-print or archived bengali literature can be converted to a plaintext format.  

## Releases 
Please check the [Releases](https://github.com/srdg/unarchived_ben_tess/releases) tab for latest updates on the status. 
Current approaches do not show any significant performance improvements. Experimentation is needed to enhance the performance.

## Training data
Training data is obtained from converting and cleaning line-level images from [this archived text](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.356857).
